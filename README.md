This site currently has two images and two projects. 

This first folder is called albatross and contains images and writing about the studio. 

Here is the first image:
![My Image](projects/images/albatross1.jpg)

Here is the second image:
![My Image](projects/images/albatross/albatross1.jpg)

I find this image especially compelling because it shows my foam cutter.

While im here, I might as well test some gif functionality:

Got a little write up on that visible here:
