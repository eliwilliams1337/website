This site currently has two images and two projects. 

This first folder is called albatross and contains images and writing about the studio. 

Here is the first image:

I find this image especially compelling because it shows my foam cutter.

While im here, I might as well test some gif functionality:

Got a little write up on that visible here:

Finally, today is December 28th and I took a drive in my dads 69 vette, which he put new wheels on:
