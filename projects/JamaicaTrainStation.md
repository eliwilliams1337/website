# Jamaica Train Station Design Project

## About

I was given the opportunity to develop a new syllabus for Fourth Year Students at NYIT, focusing on issues concerning urbanism in the five boroughs. 

The project focused on three main issues related to the site:

	Interlocking transportation modes at the Jamaica Station complex
	
		* MTA Queens Bus Hub for MTA and NYCT, with over 20 distinct routes
		
		* Primary Long Island Rail Road Transfer Station
		
		* Eastern extents of MTA Subway Lines E and J.
	
	Role of the city and developers in corporate expansion into diverse and economically impoverished areas
		
		* Large speculative mixed use housing projects now dominate the site
		
		* Met with Greater Jamaica Development Corporation to understand corporate structuring
		
	Architectural and Engineering Complexity
	
		* Interconnectivity, fume and weight support needed for train system
		
		* Overly complex circulation on the site is currently a mix of ~5 different large projects
		
		* Site serves as the face of NY for a majority of international visitors, acting as a bizarre icon.
