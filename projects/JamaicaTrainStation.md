# Jamaica Train Station Design Project

## About

I was given the opportunity to develop a new syllabus for Fourth Year Students at NYIT, focusing on issues concerning urbanism in the five boroughs. 

The project focused on three main issues related to the site:

_Interlocking transportation modes at the Jamaica Station complex_

* MTA Queens Bus Hub for MTA and NYCT, with over 20 distinct routes

* Primary Long Island Rail Road Transfer Station

* Eastern extents of MTA Subway Lines E and J.

_Role of the city and developers in corporate expansion into diverse and economically impoverished areas_

* Large speculative mixed use housing projects now dominate the site

* Met with Greater Jamaica Development Corporation to understand corporate structuring

_Architectural and Engineering Complexity_

* Interconnectivity, fume and weight support needed for train system

* Overly complex circulation on the site is currently a mix of ~5 different large projects

* Site serves as the face of NY for a majority of international visitors, acting as a bizarre icon.

### Course Design

14 weeks total

* 2 weeks precedent analysis and prototyping

* 4 weeks individual research and Development

* 6 weeks final work towards complete proposals
