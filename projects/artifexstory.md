# ARTIFEX TECHNOLOGIES

## About

Talking about a research forward start up is never easy.

I encourage any students/first time founders who are interested to reach out at the bottom of the page to learn more. This is the basics of how/what/why


### Why We Existed

ARTIFEX came out of my research at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, analyzing and developing solutions for the disconnects between preservation 3D scanning and Architectural Drawing. I worked with Anna Baytosh, who was an amazing business partner and friend through the whole process and provided the backbone for the successes we achieved.

## What We Did (roughly in this order)

* Built early stage hardware prototypes

* Created interpretation scripts and loggers for PJRC Teensy Units to collect building data

* Competed for SBIR Grants

* Raised money from various investors (including Launch Incubator Jason Calacanis)

* Built software prototypes to interpret and visualize this data

* Built a web app version that interpreted scans and data from other sources

* Worked on a bunch of awesome projects with amazing people

* Got everyday people on our [platform](artifex.tools)
